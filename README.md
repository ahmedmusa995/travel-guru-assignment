# Project: Travel Guru

Travel Guru is travel guide for travellers as it's name refer.Though the main focus of this project was to learn several login system, I had done a lot of fancy things on this site. The most important and interesting part, for me, was integrating google map in this site. It was fun to learn new thing without any instruction from our instructor. In the home page of this site users can see three places where he can visit and if he hover over any of them he can see some details information about this place. After clicking those places he will be redirected to the login page as he was not logged in. If he log in first in the home page then he will be redirected to the booking page directly. In booking page there is a form which should be filled up before submit. After submit he will be redirected to the page where he can see hotel's information and the location of the place he has selected in a google map on the right side.
